The Egyptologist Flinders Petrie was the first to organize pottery, using clay, surface treatment, and shape as the basic criteria in his corpus for dating Predynastic vessels. Petrie\\s categories are not completely consistent.  He did not always separate clay material from technological aspects, but the categories were logical, and so scholars still use them today.  

Predynastic pottery is made from either Nile clay or marl clay.  The first produces a red, brown, or black surface when fired, while the second generate a hard dense fabric of white, green, orange, or beige.  Marl clay was not used prior to Naqada II (ca. 3600 B.C.), and its introduction in the pottery repertoire marked a significant innovation in how some vessels were subsequently produced.  The consistency among form and decoration of marl clay vessels indicates that for the first time, specialist - not local potters - manufacture pottery.  

The method used by a potter to prepare the vessel\\s surface also characterized the finished vessel.  Slipping burnishing, polishing, and applied decoration were all used to finish Predynastic pottery.  Firing temperatures and conditions also created differences in a vessel\\s final appearance.

Facing the same direction as the pair in the chariot is a goddess (white slip), perhaps Artemis. Artemis (?) holds torches (?) in her upraised hands. Dionysos, holding a drinking horn and wearing an ivy wreath on his head faces Artemis. Standing at the horses' heads is a male figure, whose head is obscured by the animals. This figure is marked as the god Hermes by his winged boots. The iconography of this vase may represent a nuptial scene. A double row of ivy circles the neck. The upper edge of this figural scene is bordered by a row of tongues. Lateral bands of dots frame the scene. Two then red lines circle the base.

The Egyptologist Flinders Petrie was the first to organize pottery, using clay, surface treatment, and shape as the basic criteria in his corpus for dating Predynastic vessels. Petrie\\s categories are not completely consistent.  He did not always separate clay material from technological aspects, but the categories were logical, and so scholars still use them today.  

Predynastic pottery is made from either Nile clay or marl clay.  The first produces a red, brown, or black surface when fired, while the second generate a hard dense fabric of white, green, orange, or beige.  Marl clay was not used prior to Naqada II (ca. 3600 B.C.), and its introduction in the pottery repertoire marked a significant innovation in how some vessels were subsequently produced.  The consistency among form and decoration of marl clay vessels indicates that for the first time, specialist - not local potters - manufacture pottery.  

The method used by a potter to prepare the vessel\\s surface also characterized the finished vessel.  Slipping burnishing, polishing, and applied decoration were all used to finish Predynastic pottery.  Firing temperatures and conditions also created differences in a vessel\\s final appearance.

The Egyptologist Flinders Petrie was the first to organize pottery, using clay, surface treatment, and shape as the basic criteria in his corpus for dating Predynastic vessels. Petrie's categories are not completely consistent.  He did not always separate clay material from technological aspects, but the categories were logical, and so scholars still use them today.  

Predynastic pottery is made from either Nile clay or marl clay.  The first produces a red, brown, or black surface when fired, while the second generate a hard dense fabric of white, green, orange, or beige.  Marl clay was not used prior to Naqada II (ca. 3600 B.C.), and its introduction in the pottery repertoire marked a significant innovation in how some vessels were subsequently produced.  The consistency among form and decoration of marl clay vessels indicates that for the first time, specialist - not local potters - manufacture pottery.  

The method used by a potter to prepare the vessel's surface also characterized the finished vessel.  Slipping burnishing, polishing, and applied decoration were all used to finish Predynastic pottery.  Firing temperatures and conditions also created differences in a vessel's final appearance.

The Egyptologist Flinders Petrie was the first to organize pottery, using clay, surface treatment, and shape as the basic criteria in his corpus for dating Predynastic vessels. Petrie\\s categories are not completely consistent.  He did not always separate clay material from technological aspects, but the categories were logical, and so scholars still use them today.  

Predynastic pottery is made from either Nile clay or marl clay.  The first produces a red, brown, or black surface when fired, while the second generate a hard dense fabric of white, green, orange, or beige.  Marl clay was not used prior to Naqada II (ca. 3600 B.C.), and its introduction in the pottery repertoire marked a significant innovation in how some vessels were subsequently produced.  The consistency among form and decoration of marl clay vessels indicates that for the first time, specialist - not local potters - manufacture pottery.  

The method used by a potter to prepare the vessel\\s surface also characterized the finished vessel.  Slipping burnishing, polishing, and applied decoration were all used to finish Predynastic pottery.  Firing temperatures and conditions also created differences in a vessel\\s final appearance.
