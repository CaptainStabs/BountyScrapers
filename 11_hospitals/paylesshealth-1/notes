I am aware that `https://onlinepatientestimation.com/PatientPortal/site/HenryCountyMedicalCenter` redirects, but it's the only way to access the proper page

Dell Children's is owned by ascension hence the different domain for indirect url

BROWNFIELD REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER's website went down so I could not get the indirect url
